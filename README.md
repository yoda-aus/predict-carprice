
## Objective
The goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of the analysis, one should provide clear recommendations to a client—a used car dealership—as to what consumers value in a used car.

## Dataset Description

The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure the speed of processing.
It contains fields 
 0   id            426880 non-null  int64  
 1   region        426880 non-null  object 
 2   price         426880 non-null  int64  
 3   year          425675 non-null  float64
 4   manufacturer  409234 non-null  object 
 5   model         421603 non-null  object 
 6   condition     252776 non-null  object 
 7   cylinders     249202 non-null  object 
 8   fuel          423867 non-null  object 
 9   odometer      422480 non-null  float64
 10  title_status  418638 non-null  object 
 11  transmission  424324 non-null  object 
 12  VIN           265838 non-null  object 
 13  drive         296313 non-null  object 
 14  size          120519 non-null  objec

## Findings
- Old cars with low odometer values have a potential to be sold quickly.
- Gathering more comprehensive and diverse data on used cars, including additional features such as maintenance history,market demand, could enrich the prediction model
