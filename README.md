
## Objective
The goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of the analysis, one should provide clear recommendations to a client—a used car dealership—as to what consumers value in a used car.

## Dataset Description

The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure the speed of processing.
It contains fields:
-	id              426880
- region          426880
- price           426880
- year            425675
- manufacturer    409234
- model           421603
- condition       252776
- cylinders       249202
- fuel            423867
- odometer        422480
- title_status    418638
- transmission    424324
- VIN             265838
- drive           296313
- size            120519
- type            334022
- paint_color     296677
- state           426880

## Findings
- Old cars with low odometer values have a potential to be sold quickly.
- Gathering more comprehensive and diverse data on used cars, including additional features such as maintenance history,market demand, could enrich the prediction model
